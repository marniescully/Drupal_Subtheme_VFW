<a href="http://drupal.subtheme.marniescully.biz">A Drupal Sub-theme of Bootstrap for VFW website </a>

I developed CMS Websites for the Harvard Extension School Course <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/academics/courses/introduction-web-content-management-systems-site-development/24048?_ga=1.137611504.196943689.1456622945">Intro to Web Content Management Systems Site Development.</a> The intention was to demonstrate the ability to develop solutions on each CMS platform with the modules and extensions specific to each. I had permission from the Palmerton United Veterans Organization to utilize their content, but they opted not to choose a CMS solution ultimately.

I also developed the same website in <a href="http://joomla.vfw.marniescully.biz">Joomla,</a> a <a href="http://drupal.custom.theme.marniescully.biz">Drupal Custom Theme</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.vfw.marniescully.biz">WordPress.</a>
